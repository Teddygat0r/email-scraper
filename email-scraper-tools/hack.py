I am reaching out to you because I recently applied to the Summer 2024 SWE Intern position at {company_name}, and I believe I have qualifications that might interest you.

I am a student majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washington @ Seattle. I am familiar with many frontend tech stacks (React, Next, Vue, Tailwind) and machine learning frameworks (Tensorflow, Pytorch, SciKit). You can see examples of my work on my personal portfolio [https://teddygat0r.vercel.app]

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Iâ€™ve also attached my resume if you ever need it!

Thank you,
Joshua Zhang
